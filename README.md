# AI-sentiment-analysis

We were given several datasets from the website https://www.trictrac.net/, which sells a variety of board games.
This website collects data for every article, such as reviews and grades posted by the users. Our task was to treat
and analyze this data to gain valuable insights from it. One purpose was to classify these reviews and predict the
sentiment (positive or negative).

This is a real-world application as the company could automatically gain insight on products by correlating
words with grades. Utilizing word vector representation and dimensionality reduction helps establish meaningful
associations between words and the sentiment expressed in reviews. By exploring the represented space, the company
could identify trends in customer preferences, potentially increasing sales.

The features X represents the comment column, and the target variable y is grade. In this report, we aim to
uncover valuable insights from these reviews and effectively capture and quantify the sentiments conveyed. We will
discuss our methodology, data processing approaches, and the potential of our findings.

Please read our report (file name rapport.pdf) for more detailed information.
